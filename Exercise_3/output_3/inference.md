## Inference from executing Q3

The webpage was downloaded using the recursive flag which ensures that any links inside the index.html also gets downloaded. For testing I downloaded the official wikipedia page of Alan Turing.

Although I tried downloading the webpages multiple times during the day, I didn't notice substantial changes in the execution time for the different iterations and on average only a maximum of 10% was the difference between slowest and fastest download times which can also be due to the fluctuations in the internet speed.
